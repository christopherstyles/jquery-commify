[jQuery Commify](http://www.christopherstyles.com/jquery-commify) - Adding commas to your boring numbers.
================================

The jQuery Commify extension provides an easy way to add commas to numbers without them. While not required, there are several customizations you can make, such as adding a prefix ('$' for a monetary value would be the most obvious here, but could just as easily be '%' or '&euro;'), or rounding the number off to a 10th or 100th etc.
